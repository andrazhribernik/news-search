# News Search

This project contains the code for searching through our dataset of news, blog posts, Twitter and Facebook data using Hadoop.

## Structure
* **src/** - the source code for Hadoop search job
* **target/** - the Hadoop search job deployed to a runnable JAR
* **web-page/** - the folder for everything connected with the web page
	* **api/** - the REST api for communication with Hadoop client
	* **client/** - the client for communication with the api on the web server and for running the jobs on Hadoop cluster
	* **lib/** - library of common stuff
	* **www/** - the front page for our web page along with the corresponding PHP code

	
## Usage
To run the search use `hadoop jar <path to the JAR> <additional arguments>`. There are several arguments required. To see help, just run the command without any arguments. 

## Development information
